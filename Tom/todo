COMPLETED
- Create a class for the user
- Create a class for the recipe
- Create a class for the diets
- Re-organise recipe for Json loading and make it so it reads in as a string then during initalisation loops through and grabs ingredient 
- JSON save a load system for all data that is needed in the program 
- Move Ingredients into a seperate Json file, and have a pointer in recipes to them
- Come up with a better name then tempName 
- Look over bbc good foods and decide all the tags we want 
- Look into moving diet out of tags in recipes for easier referencing 
- Search system : Make it so the only recipes displayed are ones that are on your diet plan , unless selected otherwise
- Look into tags don't think they need to be a class
- Look into splitting recipes into diet types so we know how many we have for each 
- Saving new user : need to make it check if there already a foler with the same name before saving to avoid errors
- Reorganise recipe Json and class
- Change the folder structure of users so it includes a folder id instead of using the name so when a user is being created its folder can be created straight away 
- make the jsons file name also the id 
- Create a way to link tag / diet icons to the tags and diets of recipes : essentially make a data strucutre which holds the name of the diet / tag and the image associated with it this funciton is called before the recipe page and return this data structure  



COMPLETED FIRST PASS

IN PROGRESS
- Clean up files to put all the data type classes together 
- Add proper icons for the rest of the diets and add that to the code
- Re-organise wiki to arrange it for the important classes as well as add a table of contents
- Users can be deleted and edited 
- Add recipes 
- Continue creation of functions to help speed up the GUI creation 
- Code clean up targeting un-used variables and functions
- Code clean up targeting pathing changing static paths to use Pointers class 
- Code clean up targeting commenting and readability  

TODO
- Tech Debt 
- Look over all the functions in the classes and see if they can be organised and paired together in a better way 
- Creation of a user allow them to upload a profile picture and reuse that code for users wanting to change theirs
- Dynamic pointer in Pointers class for current user so don't have to keep creating path
- Search via ingredients feature where the user enters the ingredient and quantity and will search for recipes which have those ingredients or most of them 90% is limit, populate the ingredient list while they are typing select an ingredient then add a quantity and when they are done press search
